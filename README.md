# Control_robot
The modeling and control of a 4 Degrees of Freedom (GDL) robot arm will be performed. What is expected to be obtained with this system is the first stage in a model-based design, achieving a realistic simulation of the real behavior of the system that can be used for its iterative design. 

The first step will consist of obtaining a mathematical model that represents the plant to be controlled. In this case, the plant will be represented by the dynamic linkage of the robotic arm with its actuators: permanent magnet direct current (DC) motors. For the same, design software (Solidworks) and simulation (MATLAB) will be available.  

As a next step, a robust controller will be developed, using a combination of state space controllers and PID controllers. A comparison will be made between a PID control with speed feedback and an I-PD control of the same type. Because of this, it will be necessary to estimate the speed values, for which state observers will be available.

In addition, the complete system model will be simulated in order to analyze the correct operation of the system and its capacity for improvement. Finally, simulations with different trajectories will be carried out, where the control will be tested, both for common applications and for extreme cases.
